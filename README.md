#Real-Time Flood Prediction and Alert System

This project implements a Real-Time Flood Prediction and SMS Alert System using machine learning and a web interface. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and a Flask-based web application integrated with Twilio for real-time SMS alerts. It is designed to assist in flood risk prediction using environmental and meteorological data.

#Features
->Data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and visualization

->Machine Learning models including XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and GradientBoosting

->Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix

->Flask web app for user interaction

->Real-time deployment using ngrok

->SMS alert system via Twilio API for critical flood warnings

#Technologies Used
->Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

->Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

->Flask, Pyngrok, Twilio
